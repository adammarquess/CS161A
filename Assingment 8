/* 
Program Name:
Grade Calculator 
Program Description:
using inputs calculate letter grade 

Design:
A. INPUT
   int numOfAssignments = 0;
    double averageAssignmentScore = 0.0;
    double midterm = 0.0;
    double finalExam = 0.0;
  
B. OUTPUT

double finalScore = 0.0;
char grade;



C. CALCULATIONS
avarage of assignments 
total final asssignment score 
catagory of letter grade 

D. LOGIC and ALGORITHMS
Design the logic of your program using pseudocode or flowcharts. 
Use conditionals, loops, functions or array constructs.
List the steps in transforming inputs into outputs.
